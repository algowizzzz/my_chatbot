LCH maintains a Recovery Plan and a Wind Down Plan, both of which are reviewed at least annually, or following material 
changes, and approved by the LCH Board  
The Wind Down Plan sets out the steps it would be necessary to follow should LCH need to wind down its clearing business  
The plan sets out the roles and responsibilities of the internal functions to ensure an orderly wind down of the activities 
within six months  In addition, this plan takes into account the impact of such a wind down on external stakeholders such

impacts to LCH‚Äôs clearing members       
LCH  holds  capital  equal  to  the  operating  expenses  for  the  six-month  period  required  to  wind  down   LCH  bases  its 
calculation on the latest audited expenses   
LCH  invests  its  capital  including  the  capital  used  to  cover  general  business  risks  and  the  wind  down  plan  in  very  high 
quality, very liquid instruments with low market risk, in line with applicable regulatory requirements  LCH capital is held on 
the balance sheet of LCH separately from the resources designated to cover clearing members‚Äô defaults  
 
Key Consideration 4: 
Assets held to cover general 
business  risk  should  be  of 
high  quality  and  sufficiently 
liquid  in  order  to  allow  the 
FMI to meet  its current and 
projected operating 
expenses  under  a  range  of 
scenarios, including in 
adverse market conditions  
LCH‚Äôs assets held to cover business risk are composed of short-term reverse repos, the purchase  of short  term highly 
liquid government securities and overnight cash deposits  The maturity profile of the reverse repos and cash held to cover 
general business risk means no conversion of assets is required  The securities are high quality, very liquid and with low 
market risk   
LCH  assesses  the  quality  and  degree  of  liquidity  and  marked  to  market  value  of  its  liquid  net  assets  through  daily 
monitoring, regular reporting and monthly internal governance reviews

                            LCH  is 
connected to a number of intermediaries to perform its services, including other FMIs such as interoperating CCPs, CSDs 
and other parties used for settlement, payment or custody purposes; and LCH ensures fair and open access to and from 
these in line with applicable regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions where it operates, as well as its internal standards    
LCH  is  partly  owned  by  its  clearing  members,  which  therefore  are  included  in  the  LCH  governance  process  by  being 
represented on relevant committees  The LCH Board and the LCH Board Risk Committee include user and independent 
director representation  LCH also has several advisory and risk working groups related to specific clearing services where 
new product initiatives, collateral extensions, and projects are discussed with clearing members  Proposals for significant 
changes  to  risk  models  must  be  reviewed with  clearing  members  in  these  working  groups,  and  their  views  will  be 
documented and included with the proposals where approval is necessary, including at the Risk Committee and Board  
Through these forums and clearing member consultation, LCH ensures appropriate consideration of its users‚Äô needs  
Any change which may fundamentally affect the way LCH operates will involve a change to the LCH Rulebook and such 
changes are considered by the Rule Change Committee  This Committee will independently assess the changes and set 
a minimum time for clearing member consultation for rule amendments that are deemed material  Feedback received from 
clearing members is assessed and any further material changes proposed will be considered again by the Rule Change 
Committee before they can be made live  Further, LCH is an active market participant, providing thought leadership into 
industry-wide initiatives to promote financial stability and to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the markets  Any 
significant change that fundamentally affects the LCH operating model are made only after clearing member consultation

Additionally, clearing members are involved in the development and testing of new service releases of technology relating 
to new products, services or systems   
The LCH client management functions collect and collate enhancement and change requests from clearing members and 
submit to senior management for consideration  
Key  Consideration  2: An 
FMI   should   have   clearly 
defined goals and 
objectives that are 
measurable and 
achievable,  such  as  in  the 
areas  of  minimum  service 
levels,    risk    management 
expectations,  and  business 
priorities  
LCH‚Äôs corporate strategic objectives are: 
‚Ä¢ To provide market leading risk management and clearing solutions   
‚Ä¢ To manage our members‚Äô and clients‚Äô risk by providing effective and efficient clearing services  
‚Ä¢ To promote a safe and stable financial market foremost in all that we do   
The strategy for achieving these objectives is to continue to offer LCH‚Äôs proven risk management capabilities across a 
range of asset classes with a commitment to partner with clearing members to develop the services that make markets 
more efficient and safe   
The LCH Board, through its internal governance process, creates and maintains well defined strategic and financial plans  
Progress against goals and objectives are included in the publicly available consolidated LCH Group report and accounts    
LCH senior management reporting enables the LCH Board to assess and have oversight of the progress of LCH against 
its goals and objectives, in line with the strategy and the priorities of its senior management  LCH management assesses 
performance against its annual corporate strategic objectives on a quarterly basis  Performance against these objectives 
is reported to the LCH Group Board and the LCH Remuneration Committee

                            However, to date, there have never been any exceptions granted to the collateral policy for LCH  Exceptions are available 
as a contingency measure and only to be used in exceptional circumstances  The Collateral Risk policy is reviewed annually, 
and any revisions are subject to LCH Board approval  
To provide flexibility in collateral eligibility, LCH accepts a range of currencies and traded securities as initial margin  LCH 
maintains a list of collateral eligible for use in its services on its website, including details of haircuts  Typically, LCH engages 
with its participants in advance of changes to collateral eligibility to minimise any disruption from such changes   
LCH operates and maintains CMS through which requests by clearing members to deposit or release collateral are made  
CMS lists only LCH eligible collateral, thereby preventing the submission or receipt into the CCP of ineligible collateral  

LCH Limited | 2024 CPMI-IOSCO PFMI Self-Assessment

LCH maintains a framework for the monitoring and identification of wrong-way and other concentration risks  The collateral 
risk framework covers several risks, including wrong-way and concentration risk, that require review and escalation when 
breaches of concentration limits occur, along with mitigation steps  
LCH‚Äôs risk policies are reviewed on an annual basis    
Key  Consideration  2: An 
FMI should establish 
prudent  valuation  practices 
and  develop  haircuts  that 
are   regularly   tested   and 
take  into  account  stressed 
market conditions  
LCH marks its collateral holdings to market daily using observed market prices from published sources in accordance with 
internal LCH policy  LCH introduced additional checks during the review period, whereby it tests its ability to stand up an 
alternative price data source for collateral valuation using an additional vendor  This ensures LCH is able to mark-to-market 
collateral on a real time basis, even in the event its main data provider is unavailable  
LCH is entitled to give any instrument or security lodged as collateral a zero value if it is found in any way to be unacceptable  
Further, if, in the opinion of LCH, any asset that has been transferred to it by a clearing member as collateral is no longer 
either of sufficient value or otherwise acceptable to LCH, it shall be entitled to demand further collateral from such member, 
in keeping with the LCH Rulebook provisions  
LCH‚Äôs internal policy defines its collateral haircut framework; the framework includes regular monitoring and review of 
haircuts, and a stress testing regime  that contains extreme but plausible scenarios  Collateral haircuts are  made  up of a 
base haircut as well as add-ons, and cover market risk, credit risk, wrong-way risk and FX risk in addition to concentration 
and liquidity risk  The methodology used takes into consideration various factors including the ability to realise the value of 
a piece of collateral, appropriate lookback periods, attributes of issuers and price correlations  Haircuts must also comply 
with the internal policy on procyclicality  FX haircuts are determined based on the historic volatility of the relevant currency 
pair and are applied consistently across all collateral, cash or securities  
Key   Consideration   3: In 
order to reduce the need for 
procyclical  adjustments,  an 
FMI should  establish stable 
and   conservative   haircuts 
that are calibrated to include 
periods  of  stressed  market 
conditions,   to   the   extent 
practicable and prudent  
During  the  routine  review  of  haircuts  in  normal  and  stressed  market  conditions,  LCH  may  defer  or  phase  in  changes  to 
haircuts, if deemed necessary, to avoid excessively procyclical effects in accordance with the LCH Procyclicality policy  LCH 
internal policies require that a 10-year price history, plus a stress period, is to be used in haircut calibrations thereby reducing 
the need for procyclical adjustments

                            In    all 
cases,    an    FMI    should 
document    its    supporting 
rationale   for,   and   should 
have appropriate 
governance   arrangements 
relating  to,  the  amount  and 
form of total liquid resources 
it maintains  
also subject to  annual review by the  Board Risk Committee, which  in turn makes recommendation  to the LCH  Board for 
approval  
 
Key  Consideration  10: An 
FMI should establish explicit 
rules  and  procedures  that 
enable   the   FMI   to   effect 
same-day and, where 
appropriate,   intraday   and 
multiday settlement of 
payment obligations on time 
following  any  individual  or 
combined default among its 
participants     These rules 
and     procedures     should 
address    unforeseen    and 
potentially uncovered 
LCH maintains arrangements for ensuring settlement finality as described in the assessment of compliance with Principle 8  
These  arrangements  along  with  its  liquidity  risk  framework  (see  above - Key  Consideration  1)  provide  the  structure  for 
ensuring LCH can settle payment obligations on time even in the event of participant(s) default  LCH‚Äôs Liquidity Risk policy 
requires and sets parameters for a minimum liquidity buffer over and above the total liquidity requirement   
The  liquidity  risk  framework  has  key  tests  which  are  used  to  determine  the  liquidity  requirement  in  the  event  of  member 
default(s):  the  intraday  liquidity  stress  test  and  the  30-day  liquidity  stress  test   The  30-day  liquidity  stress  test  forecasts 
liquidity requirements that arise over the next 30 business days under stressed market conditions and assumes the default 
of the two member groups with the largest liquidity requirements, plus a stressed business-as-usual target   
Consequently, LCH‚Äôs Liquidity Risk Framework ensures that it maintains significant excess liquidity to meet intraday and 
daily liquidity needs following the default of the two clearing members (with their affiliates and clients) with the largest liquidity 
requirements   The  LCH  Liquidity  Plan  and  the  Recovery  Plan  describe  the  actions  that  LCH  could  take  to  address  any 
uncovered liquidity shortfall and the replenishment of its liquidity resources  For example, the Liquidity Plan incorporates the

liquidity shortfalls and 
should aim to avoid 
unwinding,     revoking,     or

settlement of payment 
obligations  These rules and 
procedures     should     also 
indicate  the  FMI‚Äôs  process 
to   replenish   any   liquidity 
resources   it   may   employ 
during  a  stress  event,  so 
that    it    can    continue    to

manner  
tools  that  can  be  used  to  fund  operational  and  default  liquidity  needs  and  assesses  all  the  available  tools  under  various 
scenarios including during periods of market stress or a ‚Äòliquidity event‚Äô (defined as a situation where there is an actual or 
perceived risk of a shortfall)  Restricted access to liquidity sources is also incorporated in LCH‚Äôs liquidity stress testing

Principle 8: Settlement Finality 
An FMI should provide clear and certain final settlement, at a minimum by the end of the value date   Where necessary or preferable, an FMI 
should provide final settlement intraday or in real time  
LCH‚Äôs arrangements for ensuring settlement finality are founded on the designation of LCH under the UK Financial Markets and Insolvency (Settlement 
Finality)  Regulations  1999  (UK  SFR);  Rulebook  provisions;  and  the  commissioning  of  legal  opinions  in  support of  the  applicable  provisions  within  its

                            Key  Consideration  3: An 
FMI   should   have   clearly 
defined operational 
reliability    objectives    and 
should    have    policies    in 
place  that  are  designed  to 
achieve those objectives  
LCH‚Äôs corporate strategic objective underpin the firm‚Äôs commitment to effective risk, control, stability management  The 
first two corporate objectives being ‚Äòto provide market-leading  risk  management  and  resilience  standards  and  clearing 
solutions‚Äô and ‚Äòto manage our members‚Äô and clients‚Äô risk by providing effective and efficient clearing services‚Äô  The Board 
sets a risk appetite and endorses the LCH Risk Management Framework to manage reliance, reliability, and stability of the 
CCP, which is cascaded throughout the firm  LCH has further defined service levels based on key performance indicators  
Key  Consideration  4: An 
FMI  should  ensure  that  it 
has scalable capacity 
adequate to handle 
increasing  stress  volumes 
and  to  achieve  its  service-
level objectives  
Minimum systems capacity levels are equal to two times the peak of at least the previous two years and must be tested 
annually  The capacity testing must cover key processes such as those for registering trades and calculating margin and 
settlement   Services  experiencing  significant  growth  in  volumes  are  expected  to  forecast  their  future  requirements  and 
ensure that sufficient capacity will exist in the future  
The policy also requires that technology systems supporting critical services must meet a stressed capacity requirement  
Capacity utilisation must be monitored at least daily and stressed capacity tested at least annually  In addition, each service 
is the subject of monthly service reviews, which include an assessment of key performance indicators, such as capacity  
Furthermore, ahead of the implementation of new products or material system changes, LCH performs testing to provide 
assurance that system capacity will be, or will remain, adequate for normal and stressed volumes   
LCH systems are subject to regular risk based independent review by the internal audit function   
Should  real-time  system  monitoring  and  monthly  service  reviews  reveal  capacity  performance  and  trends  which  have 
disrupted  or  may  disrupt  operational  functioning,  action  will  be  taken  to  investigate  the  cause  and  identify  necessary 
timelines for increasing headroom for capacity  If capacity were to be exceeded, this would be investigated and remediated  
Following remediation LCH would investigate the root cause and implement steps to prevent reoccurrence  
Key  Consideration  5: An 
FMI should have 
comprehensive physical 
and    information    security 
policies   that   address   all 
LCH  has  a  number  of  policies,  standards  and  controls  in  place  for  safeguarding  its  physical  and  information  security  
Regular  reviews  are  undertaken  to  understand  potential  vulnerabilities  and  threats  i e ,  physical,  intrusion  and  natural 
disaster, that LCH may be subject to

potential  vulnerabilities  and
